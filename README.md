# 🧮 Git Calculator Case Study

## 📘 Overview

This project simulates a real-world software development scenario where **multiple developers** collaborate using **Git** and **GitHub** to build a **simple calculator** application.

The goal is to demonstrate Git best practices including branching, merging, pull requests, conflict resolution, and collaboration.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Scenario

**Company:** Pandora Travel Co.  
**Challenge:** With teams distributed globally, developers need a reliable **Source Control Management (SCM)** process to prevent merge issues and downtime.  
**Solution:** Use **Git** with feature branches and pull requests to build and manage changes collaboratively.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- 🐍 Python (for calculator logic)
- 🔧 Git (for version control)
- 🌐 GitHub (for collaboration)

## 🎯 Features to Implement

Each developer contributes one feature via a separate Git branch:

| Developer | Feature        | Branch Name          |
|-----------|----------------|----------------------|
| Dev 1     | Addition        | `feature/addition`   |
| Dev 2     | Subtraction     | `feature/subtraction`|
| Dev 3     | Multiplication  | `feature/multiplication` |
| Dev 4     | Division        | `feature/division`   |
